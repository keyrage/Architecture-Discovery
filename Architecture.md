Goals
- Build a reliable picture of current state of a running system within a window of time
- Be able to use the raw system data for multiple purposes (software asset, audit, topology)
- Be able to export that view to a variety of architecture modelling tools

Approach
- Collect raw data data from systems and push to a central collection point
- Retain raw data to allow for reprocessing
- Process and create objects using reference data to translate the "system" information into higher order abstractions and relationships
- Transform and Export to modelling tools

Discovery -> Transport -> Aggregate -> Store -> Process & Abstract -> Transform & Export
